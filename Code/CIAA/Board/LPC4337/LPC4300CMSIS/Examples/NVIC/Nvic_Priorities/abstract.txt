@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to configure NVIC priority grouping for testing 
		tail-chaining/Late-arriving interrupt mode.
	Process:
		This example uses 2 interrupts as IRQ channels.
		Defining "SAME_GROUP" to chose interrupt mode test.
			- Define SAME_GROUP: Tail-chainning interrupt testing
			WIC interrupt is assigned group-priority = 1, sub-priority = 7
			DAC interrupt is assigned group-priority = 1, sub-priority = 2
			Two IRQ channels has same group.So, new ISR can not pre-empt previous interrupt 
			when it's executing even if new ISR has higher priority than curren ISR
			
			- Undefine SAME_GROUP: Late-arriving interrupt testing.
			WIC interrupt is assigned group-priority = 0, sub-priority = 1
			DAC interrupt is assigned group-priority = 1, sub-priority = 1
			WIC interrupt has higher group-priority than DAC interrupt, so WIC interrupt can 
			pre-empt DAC interrupt when it's executing
		
		In this example, WIC interrupt occurs when connecting WAKEUP0 pin to 3.3V. 
		WIC interrupt will blink USB0_IND1 LED (D10) 5 times.
		
		DAC interrupt occurs periodly and toggles USB1_IND1 LED (D9) after 1000 interrupt times.

	\Keil:	includes Keil project and configuration files 
	\IAR:	includes IAR project and configuration files
	lpc43xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	Nvic_Priorities.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested only on:
			Hitex LPC4350EVA-A4-2 Board
			U-Link2 on Keil
			J-Link on IAR
	Boot mode jumper settings:
				+ Hitex Flash:
					Select boot mode jumpers [BOOT4,BOOT3,BOOT2,BOOT1] to [LOW,LOW,HIGH,HIGH]
				+ SPIFI quad SPI flash (SPIFI 64MB and 128MB):
					Select boot mode jumpers [BOOT4,BOOT3,BOOT2,BOOT1] to [LOW,LOW,LOW,HIGH]

		Jumper settings:
			- JP3: close
			- JP4: close
			- SV6: pin 15-16 is open
	Running mode:
		On Keil
			Internal SRAM mode:	This example can run on Internal SRAM mode.
						All files must be build to .elf file, this file will be loaded into Internal SRAM through a
						debugger tool before running
			Hitex Flash mode: 	All files must be built to .hex file before burn into flash
				+ This example can be run on external flash:
					* SST39X320X:
						- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
							a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
							   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
							b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 						
					SPIFI 64MB Debug mode:
				+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
						- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
							a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
							   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
							b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 
					SPIFI 128MB mode:
				+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
						- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
							a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
							   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
							b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOADs 						

		On IAR
			Built the project (F7)
			Internal SRAM mode: This example can run on Internal SRAM.
				Download and debug (CTRL + D)
				Seclect Device Cortex M4 (if any)
			Hitex Flash mode: This example can run on 
				Hitex Flash (SST39X320X external parallel flash):
					Select "Project->Download->Download active application" to burn into flash
				SPIFI quad SPI flash 128MB mode:
					Select "Project->Download->Download active application" to burn into flash
				SPIFI quad SPI flash 64MB Debug mode:
					Download and debug (CTRL + D)
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on Hitex Flash mode)
		- Step 3: Run example
				+ At the beginning, the DAC interrupt will normally happen and blink the USB1_IND1 LED (D9) in 1Hz
				+ If WIC interrupt is occurred (by connecting WAKEUP0 pin to 3.3V), USB0_IND1 LED (D10) will blink 
				5 times 
				
			- Test tail-chaining interrupt mode:
				When USB1_IND1 LED (D9) is blinking (under the effect of DAC interrupt), if connecting WAKEUP0 pin 
				to 3.3V the WIC interrupt will be generating to blink the USB0_IND1 LED (D10) 5 times right after 
				an DAC interrupt is finished 
				
			- Test late-arriving interrupt mode:
				When USB1_IND1 LED (D9) is blinking (under the effect of DAC interrupt), if connecting WAKEUP0 pin
				to 3.3V the WIC interrupt will be generating to blink the USB0_IND1 LED (D10) 5 times immediately
				without caring about the completion of the DAC interrupt. In this case, the WIC interrupt does 
				pre-empt the DAC interrupt
				After this WIC is completed, the DAC interrupt will re-start to blink the USB1_IND1 LED (D9) 
				continuously because its interrupt occurence.					

@Tip:
	- Open \Keil\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
