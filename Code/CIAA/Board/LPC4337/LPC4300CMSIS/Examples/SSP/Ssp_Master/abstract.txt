@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use SSP peripheral as master to connect with SSP slave
		Note that: this example will run combinate with slave example at folder \Slave.
		(Pls see "Step to run" part in this file for more information)
	Process:
		SSP configuration:
			- CPHA = 0: data is sampled on the first clock edge of SCK.
			- CPOL = 0: SCK is active high
			- Clock rate = 1MHz
			- DSS = 8: 8 bits per transfer
			- MSTR = 1: SSP operates in Master mode
			- FRF= 0: SPI Frame format
		After initialize buffer, SPI master will transfer/receive data to/from SSP slave
		in POLLING mode by calling 'SPI_ReadWrite( )' function.
		After transmittion completed, receive and transmit buffer will be compared, if they 
		are not similar, the program will enter infinite loop and a error notice will
		be displayed. 

@Directory contents:
	\Keil:	includes Keil project and configuration files	 
	\IAR:	includes IAR project and configuration files
	lpc43xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	Ssp_Master.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Hitex LPC4350EVA-A4-2 Board				
			U-Link2 on Keil
			J-Link on IAR
	Boot mode jumper settings:
				+ Hitex Flash:
					Select boot mode jumpers [BOOT4,BOOT3,BOOT2,BOOT1] to [LOW,LOW,HIGH,HIGH]
				+ SPIFI quad SPI flash (SPIFI 64MB and 128MB):
					Select boot mode jumpers [BOOT4,BOOT3,BOOT2,BOOT1] to [LOW,LOW,LOW,HIGH]

				
		SSP Connection:
			- P3.3 - SCK on master connects to PF.4 - SCK on slave board;
	 		- P3.6 - SSEL on master connects to PF.5 - SSEL on slave board
	  		- P3.7 - MISO on master connects to PF.6 - MISO on slave board
	  		- P3.8 - MOSI on master connects to PF.7 - MOSI on slave board
			Common ground must be connected together between two board.
						
		Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			– 115200bps 
			– 8 data bit 
			– No parity 
			– 1 stop bit 
			– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		On Keil
			Internal SRAM mode:	This example can run on Internal SRAM mode.
						All files must be build to .elf file, this file will be loaded into Internal SRAM through a
						debugger tool before running
			Hitex Flash mode: 	All files must be built to .hex file before burn into flash
				+ This example can be run on external flash:
					* SST39X320X:
						- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
							a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
							   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
							b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 						
					SPIFI 64MB Debug mode:
				+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
						- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
							a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
							   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
							b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 
					SPIFI 128MB mode:
				+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
						- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
							a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
							   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
							b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOADs 						

		On IAR
			Built the project (F7)
			Internal SRAM mode: This example can run on Internal SRAM.
				Download and debug (CTRL + D)
				Seclect Device Cortex M4 (if any)
			Hitex Flash mode: This example can run on 
				Hitex Flash (SST39X320X external parallel flash):
					Select "Project->Download->Download active application" to burn into flash
				SPIFI quad SPI flash 128MB mode:
					Select "Project->Download->Download active application" to burn into flash
				SPIFI quad SPI flash 64MB Debug mode:
					Download and debug (CTRL + D)
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into master board (if run on Hitex Flash mode) 
		- Step 3: Build "Slave\ssp_slave" example
		- Step 4: Burn this hex file into slave board.
		- Step 5: Connect UART0 port on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 6: Configure hardware, connect master board and slave board as above instruction 
		- Step 7: Configure serial display as above instruction
		- Step 8: Run example and observe SPI slave transfer result from serial display
			Note that: Press '1' to start SSP operation on master board first.

@Tip:
	- Open \Keil\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
