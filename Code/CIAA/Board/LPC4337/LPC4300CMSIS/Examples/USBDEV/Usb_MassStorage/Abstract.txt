@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to write a simple USB Mass Storage application on LPC18xx.
	Process:
		The MassStorage project is a Mass Storage simple demo run on LPC18xx
		
		If use USB Port 1, pls set Main Clock to 60Mhz in CGU_Init function
		
		It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.		
		The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
		running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

@Directory contents:
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	\IAR:	includes IAR project and configuration files
	
	DiskImg.c: 		Disk Image (LPC18xx) data
	lpc43xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	memory.h/.c: 	USB Memory Storage

	usbuser.h/.c: 	USB Custom User Module
	memory.h/.c: 	USB Memory Storage Demo (main program)

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Hitex LPC4350EVA-A4-2 Board
			U-Link2 on Keil
			J-Link on IAR
	Boot mode jumper settings:
				+ Hitex Flash:
					Select boot mode jumpers [BOOT4,BOOT3,BOOT2,BOOT1] to [LOW,LOW,HIGH,HIGH]
				+ SPIFI quad SPI flash (SPIFI 64MB and 128MB):
					Select boot mode jumpers [BOOT4,BOOT3,BOOT2,BOOT1] to [LOW,LOW,LOW,HIGH]

	
	Running mode:
		On Keil
			Internal SRAM mode:	This example can run on Internal SRAM mode.
						All files must be build to .elf file, this file will be loaded into Internal SRAM through a
						debugger tool before running
			Hitex Flash mode: 	All files must be built to .hex file before burn into flash
				+ This example can be run on external flash:
					* SST39X320X:
						- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
							a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
							   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
							b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 						
					SPIFI 64MB Debug mode:
				+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
						- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
							a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
							   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
							b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 
					SPIFI 128MB mode:
				+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
						- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
							a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
							   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
							b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOADs 						

		On IAR
			Built the project (F7)
			Internal SRAM mode: This example can run on Internal SRAM.
				Download and debug (CTRL + D)
				Seclect Device Cortex M4 (if any)
			Hitex Flash mode: This example can run on 
				Hitex Flash (SST39X320X external parallel flash):
					Select "Project->Download->Download active application" to burn into flash
				SPIFI quad SPI flash 128MB mode:
					Select "Project->Download->Download active application" to burn into flash
				SPIFI quad SPI flash 64MB Debug mode:
					Download and debug (CTRL + D)
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example (if GNU, build target "ramusb").
		- Step 2: Configure hardware as above instruction 
		- Step 3: Run Debug (if GNU use gdb_ramusb_init.jlink)
		- Step 4: After see UGL(USB Good Link). Open My Computer, you will see 'LPC18xx' disk.
		- Step 5: Open this disk, you will see 'Readme.txt' file (it has read-only attribute)
		- Step 6: Try to copy/delete another file into disk to test if Mass Storage is work well or not
		
		(Pls see "LPC43xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > USBDEV > USBMassStorage"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \Keil\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
