@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to test Bit-banding feature of Cortex-M4 processor
	Process:
		The processor memory map includes two bit-band regions. These occupy the lowest
		1MB of the SRAM and peripheral memory regions respectively.
		+ SRAM: 	Bit-band region: 	0x20000000 - 0x20100000
					Bit-band alias:		0x22000000 - 0x23FFFFFF
		+ PERI:		Bit-band region:	0x40000000 - 0x40100000
					Bit-band alias:		0x42000000 - 0x43FFFFFF
		The mapping formula:
				bit_word_offset = (byte_offset * 32) + (bit_number * 4)
				bit_word_address = bit_band_base + bit_word_offset
		where:
		+ bit_word_offset: the position of the target bit in the bit-band memory region
		+ bit_word_addr: the address of the word in the alias memory region that maps to the target bit
		+ bit_band_base: the starting address of the alias region
		+ byte_offset: the number of byte in the bit-band region that contains the targeted bit
		+ bit_number: is the bit position (0-7) of the targeted bit
		
		Note: In fact, the SRAM on LPC4300 just available in range:
					+ 0x20000000 - 0x2000FFFF: for AHB SRAM
			  So, just can set 'VAR_ADDR' with value that exits in range SRAM above.
		
		First, the program test SRAM bit-banding:
			+ read the value at VAR_ADDRESS
			Using bit-band access to:
			+ read the value at 'VAR_BIT'.
			+ clear the value at 'VAR_BIT' and print new value at VAR_ADDRESS 
			+ re-set the value at 'VAR_BIT' and print new value at VAR_ADDRESS
		Then, the program test PERIPHERAL bit-banding:
		In this case, use SPCR register for testing
			+ Assigned value SSPCR0: 0x00000020
			Use bit-band access to:
			+ read the value at 'PERI_BIT'
			+ clear the value at 'PERI_BIT' and print new value of SSPCR0 
			+ re-set the value at 'PERI_BIT' and print new value of SSPCR0

	\Keil:	includes Keil project and configuration files 	
	\IAR:	includes IAR project and configuration files
	lpc18xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	CortexM3_Bitband.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested only on:
			Hitex LPC4350EVA-A4-2 Board
			U-Link2 on Keil
			J-Link on IAR
	Boot mode jumper settings:
				+ Hitex Flash:
					Select boot mode jumpers [BOOT4,BOOT3,BOOT2,BOOT1] to [LOW,LOW,HIGH,HIGH]
				+ SPIFI quad SPI flash (SPIFI 64MB and 128MB):
					Select boot mode jumpers [BOOT4,BOOT3,BOOT2,BOOT1] to [LOW,LOW,LOW,HIGH]		
	Serial display configuration:(e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
		– 115200bps 
		– 8 data bit 
		– No parity 
		– 1 stop bit 
		– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		On Keil
			Internal SRAM mode:	This example can run on Internal SRAM mode.
						All files must be build to .elf file, this file will be loaded into Internal SRAM through a
						debugger tool before running
			Hitex Flash mode: 	All files must be built to .hex file before burn into flash
				+ This example can be run on external flash:
					* SST39X320X:
						- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
							a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
							   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
							b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 						
					SPIFI 64MB Debug mode:
				+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
						- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
							a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
							   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
							b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 
					SPIFI 128MB mode:
				+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
						- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
							a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
							   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
							b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOADs 						

		On IAR
			Built the project (F7)
			Internal SRAM mode: This example can run on Internal SRAM.
				Download and debug (CTRL + D)
				Seclect Device Cortex M4 (if any)
			Hitex Flash mode: This example can run on 
				Hitex Flash (SST39X320X external parallel flash):
					Select "Project->Download->Download active application" to burn into flash
				SPIFI quad SPI flash 128MB mode:
					Select "Project->Download->Download active application" to burn into flash
				SPIFI quad SPI flash 64MB Debug mode:
					Download and debug (CTRL + D)
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 3: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 4: Run example and observe result on serial display
			
		(Pls see "LPC43xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > Cortex-M3 > Bit-Banding"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \Keil\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
