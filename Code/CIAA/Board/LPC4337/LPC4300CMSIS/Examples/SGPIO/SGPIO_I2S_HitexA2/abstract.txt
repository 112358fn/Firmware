@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example demonstrates usage of the SGPIO peripheral to construct 
		a 4-channel I2S TX interface. In addition the USB High Speed block is used.
	
	Process:
		- Configure part to run at 204 MHz 
		- Configure USB PLL0 (USB High Speed)
		- Configure Audio PLL0
		- Configure SGPIO for a 4-stereo-channel I2S interface
		- Initialize UDA1380 CODEC
		- Start USB stack to implement stereo audio device
		- Distribute stereo signal onto four SGPIO-I2S channels
					
@Directory contents:
	\Keil:	includes Keil project and configuration files  
	lpc43xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	USB audio profile files
	Application and device files

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Hitex LPC4350 Board Rev A2
			U-Link2 on Keil
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example for Internal SRAM/SPIFI flash or external parallel flash 
		- Step 2: Load file with the debugger or program file into flash
		- Step 3: Connect USB port to PC
		- Step 4: Play audio on PC

	Known Issues:
		- After reset there is a short period (~0.5s) where the audio output is distorted.
		  This could be avoided by a convenient mute period of the UDA1380.
		- When starting from the SPIFI a second reset is required to start code execution
		  (known problem, look into chip errata)
		- When there is a flash download problem the following procedure helps in most cases:
		  o Press ISP button SW2, click RESET button SW1, release SW2
		  o start flash download procedure
@Tip:
	- Open \Keil\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
