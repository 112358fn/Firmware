@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to store data in EEPROM memory on LPC177x_8x.
	Process:
		This example will be use MODE_8_BIT to write/read data from EEPROM memory.
		First, data will be write at the position PAGE_OFFSET of PAGE_ADDR.
		Then, using EEPROM_Read() to read back data from this address.
		Data will be displayed via serial screen.
