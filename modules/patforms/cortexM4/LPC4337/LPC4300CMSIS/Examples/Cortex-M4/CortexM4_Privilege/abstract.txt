@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to change privilege to unprivilege mode and vice vesa.
	Process:
		CONTROL[0] register controls the privilege level for software execution when the 
		processor is in Thread mode. So, we can access to get/set CONTROL[0] to change Thread
		mode privilege level.
		
		Out of reset, Thread mode is privilege.
		Read CONTROL[0] to check if it is truly privilege or not.
		If Thread mode is not privilege, so it's not compliant with Cortex-M3 Technical, the 
		program will enter into infinite error loop.
		Then, set CONTROL[0] = 1, changing Thread mode to unprivilege.
		Re-check by re-read CONTROL[0] again.
		A system service will be call __SCV(). In this exception mode, we can switch back Thread 
		mode into privilege 
		(Note that:
			When Thread mode has been changed from privilege to use, it cannot change ifself back 
			to privilege. Only a handler can change the privilege of Thread mode.
			Handler mode is always privilege.
		)
		After call handler, get CONTROL[0] to check if it is truly privilege or not.
		If not, program will enter to error loop.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested only on:
			Hitex LPC4350EVA-A4-2 Board
			U-Link2 on Keil
			J-Link on IAR
	Boot mode jumper settings:
				+ Hitex Flash:
					Select boot mode jumpers [BOOT4,BOOT3,BOOT2,BOOT1] to [LOW,LOW,HIGH,HIGH]
				+ SPIFI quad SPI flash (SPIFI 64MB and 128MB):
					Select boot mode jumpers [BOOT4,BOOT3,BOOT2,BOOT1] to [LOW,LOW,LOW,HIGH]

				
		Serial display configuration:(e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			– 115200bps 
			– 8 data bit 
			– No parity 
			– 1 stop bit 
			– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		On Keil
			Internal SRAM mode:	This example can run on Internal SRAM mode.
						All files must be build to .elf file, this file will be loaded into Internal SRAM through a
						debugger tool before running
			Hitex Flash mode: 	All files must be built to .hex file before burn into flash
				+ This example can be run on external flash:
					* SST39X320X:
						- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
							a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
							   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
							b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 						
					SPIFI 64MB Debug mode:
				+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
						- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
							a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
							   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
							b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 
					SPIFI 128MB mode:
				+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
						- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
							a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
							   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
							b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOADs 						

		On IAR
			Built the project (F7)
			Internal SRAM mode: This example can run on Internal SRAM.
				Download and debug (CTRL + D)
				Seclect Device Cortex M4 (if any)
			Hitex Flash mode: This example can run on 
				Hitex Flash (SST39X320X external parallel flash):
					Select "Project->Download->Download active application" to burn into flash
				SPIFI quad SPI flash 128MB mode:
					Select "Project->Download->Download active application" to burn into flash
				SPIFI quad SPI flash 64MB Debug mode:
					Download and debug (CTRL + D)
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on Hitex Flash mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example and observe on serial display
					+ Press '1' to change into unprivilege mode
					+ Press '2' to switch back to privilege mode
			
		(Pls see "LPC43xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > Cortex-M4 > Privilege_mode"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \Keil\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
