@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example demonstrates how to use the SPIFI library to read and write
		to an external QSPI serial flash.
	Process:
		- Configure clock to SPIFI peripheral
		- Initialize SPIFI driver
		- Erase SPIFI flash with spifi_erase call
		- Write to SPIFI with spifi_program call and then use memcmp to compare SPIFI memory
		  with source buffer.
		- Status is sent to the UART, and LED D10 (near USB connector X9) is lit if successful
					
@Directory contents:
	\Keil:	includes Keil project and configuration files  
	lpc43xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	Spifi_Test.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Hitex LPC4300 Board
						
	Running mode:
		RAM mode:   This example can be run on RAM mode with debugger. 
					All files must be build to .elf file, this file will be loaded into RAM through a 
					debugger tool before running 
		ROM mode: 	All files must be built to .hex file before burn into flash
			+ This example can be run on external flash:
				* SST39X320X:
					- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
						a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\SST39X320X\Keil to
						   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
						b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 						


	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Run example and observe LED 'run' from LED1 to LED8 then roll back
		
@Tip:
	- Open \Keil\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
