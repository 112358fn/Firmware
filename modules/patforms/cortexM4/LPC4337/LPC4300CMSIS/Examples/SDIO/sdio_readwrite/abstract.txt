@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to read and write from/to SD Card
		It also measures read and write speed.
	Process:
		Prepare an SD card  and insert it into SD card holder.
		
		In single transfer mode, the example will try to write then verify data in sector 1.
		In multi transfer mode, it then will verify from sector 1 to the number that is defined in MULT_XFER_MAX_SECTORS.
		After done these step, the example will measure the read and write speed by doing reading and writing in 
		1000 x MULT_XFER_MAX_SECTORS sectors.
		
		Note that the unit is kB/s, it means 1000 Bytes/second 

@Directory contents:
	\Keil:	includes Keil project and configuration files
	\IAR:	includes IAR project and configuration files
	lpc43xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	Sdio_readwrite.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:			
		
		This example was tested on:
			Hitex LPC4300 Board:
				- close all jumpers on SV12.
				- close pin 1-2 on JP9.
				- Open all jumpers on SV3 and SV6.
				
	Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
		– 115200bps 
		– 8 data bit 
		– No parity 
		– 1 stop bit 
		– No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		>Keil project:
		Internal SRAM mode:	This example can run on Internal SRAM mode.
					All files must be build to .elf file, this file will be loaded into Internal SRAM through a
					debugger tool before running
		Hitex Flash mode: 	All files must be built to .hex file before burn into flash
			+ This example can be run on external flash:
				* SST39X320X:
					- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
						a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
						   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
						b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 						
                SPIFI 64MB Debug mode:
			+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
					- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
						a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
						   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
						b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 
                SPIFI 128MB mode:
			+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
					- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
						a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
						   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
						b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 						

		>IAR project:
			Built the project (F7)
			Internal SRAM mode:	This example can run on Internal SRAM mode.
				Download and debug (CTRL + D)
				Seclect Device Cortex M4 (if any)
			Hitex Flash mode: This example can run on Hitex Flash (external parallel flash SST39X320X), SPIFI quad SPI flash (with or without debug)
				Select "Project->Download->Download active application" to burn into flash

	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Connect UART1 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 3: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 4: Start Debug example, Run it, turn potetiometer and observe data on serial display
		
		(Pls see "LPC43xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > SDIO > SDIO_Readwrite
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open \Keil\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww workspace file to run example on IAR
