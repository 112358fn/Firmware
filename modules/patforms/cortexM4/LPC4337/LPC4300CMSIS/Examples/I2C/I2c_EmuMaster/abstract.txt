@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example configures two GPIOs to perform as SCL and SDA of an I2C master.
	Process:
		After a welcome screen is displayed via UART
		- GPIO5_12 is configured as SDA, GPIO3_13 is configured as SCL
		- These GPIOs go to the LCD connector pins #13 and #14
		- The 7" display kit (800x480) from Embedded Artists uses a PCA9532 port expander
		   to control power, backlight and contrast
		- Write into 3 registers of the PCA9532 in order to switch the display module on
		- Read display parameter data from the EEPROM device
		
		
@Directory contents:
	\Keil:	includes Keil project and configuration files  
	\IAR:	includes IAR project and configuration files
	lpc43xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	I2c_EmuMaster.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Hitex LPC4350 Board vA4 + 7" display module from Embedded Artists
			U-Link2 on Keil
			J-Link on IAR
	Boot mode jumper settings:
				+ External parallel Flash:
					Select boot mode jumpers [BOOT4,BOOT3,BOOT2,BOOT1] to [LOW,LOW,HIGH,HIGH]
				+ SPIFI quad SPI flash (SPIFI 64MB and 128MB):
					Select boot mode jumpers [BOOT4,BOOT3,BOOT2,BOOT1] to [LOW,LOW,LOW,HIGH]

		Serial configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			– 115200bps 
			– 8N1
			– No flow control 

	
	Running mode:
		On Keil
			Internal SRAM mode, external parallel flash and serial qSPI.
						
					a) Copy flash programming utilitiy files from ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
					    the following folder of your µVision installation: C:\Keil\ARM\Flash
					b) Open Keil -> Flash -> Download for flash programming 						

		On IAR
			Internal SRAM mode
					Select "Project -> Download and Debug
					
	Steps to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Program binary into flash if compiled for flash
		- Step 3: Connect UART to COM port of a PC
		- Step 4: Connect display module to LCD connector of Hitex Rev A4 board
		- Step 5: Power-on the board to run example

@Tip:
	- Open \Keil\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
	- Open \EWARM\*.eww project file to run example on IAR
