 * @warning
 * All devices use the same  structure  with  fixed  number  of  interfaces  and
 * endpoints per interface.  This is not the most efficient way of using  memory
 * since the "biggest"  device  will  make  all  the  others  potentially  waste
 * resources.  One  way  to  improve  this  would  be  generating  the  device's
 * structure with a script (like the php OSEK one) depending on  what  the  user
 *  needs.   This  is  also  particularly  important   regarding   the   control
 * transactions buffer's size, since it will need to be as large as the  largest
 * configuration descriptor among all devices (which can be quite so in  complex
 * devices such as cellphones).
