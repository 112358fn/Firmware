* @brief CIAA USB Driver
*
* @warning USB devices' addresses are stored starting from  0  (zero),  this  is
* because internally they are represented by an index. This is  NOT  the  actual
* device's address in the USB BUS, that  one  is  the  index  @b  plus  @b  one.
* Remember that address 0 is reserved for setup and initialization.
*
*
* @par Description
*
* USB driver abstraction layer between the USB  Host  Controller  and  the  user
* software. Communication is handled through IRPs (I/O Request Packets)  to/from
* a previously claimed device's interface.
*
* As of now, only one IRP can be requested at a time per device  interface.  You
* should start transactions with usb_irp(), which is intentionally non-blocking,
* and then poll usb_irp_status() waiting for  it  to  either  fail  or  complete
* successfully.  Optionally,  you  can  cancel  an  ongoing   transaction   with
* usb_irp_cancel() as long as it hasn't been completed yet.
